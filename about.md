### Sortis is your tool for staying updated, even before the dates are up.

We're all familiar with websites and online resources which predict, to a certain degree of accuracy, outcomes of
political races, supreme court decisions, major political referendums, etc. These resources are extremely useful to the politically informed and uninformed, and help establish a stronger, more transparent, and more direct link between government and the people it intends to protect.

Currently however, these resources fail to cover several key aspects of government procedure and action. On the internet today, there are minimal resources which reliably predict the chances of individual pieces of legislation being implemented into our daily lives. The ones that do exist only provide information on the federal level, and largely ignore state legislatures, which have the ability to bring forth much more effective and relevant change. Sortis aims to fix this problem by bringing in a wide variety of sources, perspectives, and algorithms in order to determine whether or not a proposed piece of law is going to pass through Oregon's state legislature, along with analysis on how greatly it's going to affect the average Oregonian.

If you're curious, look at our [methodology page](http://sortis.org/methodology/) to see our thought process in coming to these predictions.

We strive to inform, and that means improving in every area we can in order to provide the best educated predictions possible. So, if you have any questions, comments, or criticisms, feel free to send us an [email](mailto:sortis@sortis.org), or send us a ping on either [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SortisOrg) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sortisorg/).
